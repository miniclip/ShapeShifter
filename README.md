## What is ShapeShifter?

ShapeShifter is a novel approach to skinning and switching between different games inside the same Unity project.

By switching your skinned assets with alternate versions while maintaining its original GUID, this tool allows for multiple versions of the same assets to coexist without ever losing references.

It supports the following asset types:
- AnimationClip
- AnimatorController
- Folders
- GameObject
- MonoScript
- Prefabs
- SceneAsset
- ScriptableObject
- Shader
- Texture2D
- TextAsset

### Must Read

- This is an experimental package with no official release yet. Take into account that it might bring unexpected problems into your project. Make sure to have a backup.
- Latest version is dependent of your project being inside a git repository (You can find more info about this on the "How it work" Section)
